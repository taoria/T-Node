# T-Node
Node graph creation tool based on unity experimental graphview and if possible latter,GTF.
the main goal of the repo is to make graph creation easier and more intuitive.

Note **it's not usable and productive on current stage** and need  a better
development .
and it's mainly for my own use now.

The tool separate its graph editor implementation and the graph creation logic.

# Install
